## Ingredients (Variables)

*   `apples`: 6 (Type: Granny Smith, peeled, cored, sliced)
*   `sugar`: 3/4 cup (Type: Granulated)
*   `flour`: 2 tbsp (Type: All-purpose)
*   `cinnamon`: 1 tsp (Constant: SPICE_LEVEL_MEDIUM)
*   `nutmeg`: 1/4 tsp
*   `lemonJuice`: 1 tbsp
*   `pieCrust`: 1 package (Type: Double-crust, refrigerated)
*   `butter`: 1 tbsp (Cubed)
*   `eggWash`: 1 egg, beaten (Optional, for `shininess > 0.8`)

## Procedure (Function `bakePie`)

1.  **Initialize Oven:** Preheat oven to `400째F` (200째C).
2.  **Prepare Filling:**
    *   In a large bowl (memory buffer), combine `apples`, `sugar`, `flour`, `cinnamon`, `nutmeg`, and `lemonJuice`.
    *   `mix(ingredients)` until apples are evenly coated. Handle `OverflowException` if bowl is too small.
3.  **Assemble Pie:**
    *   Unroll one `pieCrust` and place in a 9-inch pie plate (output device).
    *   Transfer `appleFilling` mixture into the crust.
    *   Dot the top of the filling with `butter` cubes.
    *   Place the second `pieCrust` over the filling.
    *   Trim excess crust, seal edges, and cut vents (perform I/O).
    *   *Optional:* If `shininess > 0.8`, brush top crust with `eggWash`.
4.  **Execute Bake Cycle:**
    *   Place pie plate on a baking sheet (error handling for spills).
    *   Bake in preheated oven for `20 minutes`.
    *   Reduce oven temperature to `375째F` (190째C).
    *   Continue baking for `30-40 minutes`, or until crust is golden brown and filling is bubbly (`status == Status.COMPLETE`).
5.  **Cooldown Protocol:**
    *   Remove pie from oven.
    *   Let cool on a wire rack for at least `2 hours` before slicing (allow process to terminate gracefully).

> **Warning:** Attempting to access pie data before cooldown completion may result in `ThermalDamageException`.

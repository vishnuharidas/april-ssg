# Chapter 1: The Bug Hunt

Captain Code adjusted his glasses, the reflection of scrolling green text flashing across the lenses. "Alright team," he announced, his voice echoing slightly in the *Digital Command Center*, "we've got a **critical** bug reported in the `GalaxyRouter` module."

> The GalaxyRouter was responsible for navigating starships through the treacherous asteroid fields of the Kessel Run Nebula. A bug here could be catastrophic!

His trusty sidekick, **Syntaxia**, pointed to a holographic display. "The error logs show a `NullPointerException` originating somewhere in the `calculate_trajectory` function. It seems to happen only when plotting routes near black holes."

## Initial Analysis

Here's what we know:

1.  **Trigger:** Proximity to black holes.
2.  **Symptom:** `NullPointerException`.
3.  **Module:** `GalaxyRouter`.
4.  **Function:** `calculate_trajectory`.

*   Could it be an issue with gravitational lensing calculations?
*   Or perhaps the event horizon data is missing?

Captain Code stroked his chin. "Let's look at the code."

```java
public Trajectory calculate_trajectory(Starship ship, Destination dest, List<CelestialBody> nearbyObjects) {
    // Check for nearby black holes
    BlackHole nearestBlackHole = findNearestBlackHole(ship.getPosition(), nearbyObjects);

    if (nearestBlackHole != null && ship.distanceTo(nearestBlackHole) < DANGER_ZONE) {
        // Complex calculations involving gravitational pull
        GravitationalData gravData = nearestBlackHole.getGravitationalData(); // <-- Potential Null source?
        if (gravData == null) {
             System.err.println("Error: Gravitational data missing for " + nearestBlackHole.getId());
             // Problem: No return here, code continues!
        }
        // ... more calculations using gravData ...
        Trajectory adjustedTrajectory = adjustForGravity(ship, dest, gravData); // <-- NPE happens here if gravData is null!
        return adjustedTrajectory;
    } else {
        // Standard trajectory calculation
        return calculateStandardTrajectory(ship, dest);
    }
}
```

"Aha!" exclaimed Syntaxia. "If `getGravitationalData()` returns null, we print an error but *don't* return. The code then tries to use the null `gravData`!"

Captain Code grinned. "Precisely! A classic oversight. Patch it up, Syntaxia!"
